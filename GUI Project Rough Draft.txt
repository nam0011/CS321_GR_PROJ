Restaurant/Home Kitchen Inventory Management System

			This program will be used to create weekly/monthly/yearly expense reports for either home users or commercial kitchens to keep up with incoming and outgoing food product expenses. These reports will be displayed as graphs as well as lists of flagged items either being underused (going bad) or overused (losing money) based on a database of recipes/inventory upkept by the end user.
			This program is implemented in almost all commercial kitchens already and some are far better than others. The largest problem that our program works to fix is a difficult, often clunky, user interface for these types of programs, and aims to increases the ease of workflow for the managers/home chefs who wish to have an easier way to manage their inventory.
			This program will meet all required components by:
1. Using classes, objects, dynamically allocated memory to hide information from end user
2. Have a GUI that is easy to use for any application
3. Use an outside source(database/xml file) to import initial data used to build on
4. User will enter information that will update said source for future updates
5. Data will be presented in a well formed manner using graphs and lists

* We can do this program for either home or commercial kitchens does not matter to me
o Pros for at home:
* Less UX code to write no pricing/sales evaluations
* Easier to test will be a very straightforward program
* Should turn out very user friendly and will have more time to make a nicer looking UI
o Pros for commercial:
* Program will look more professional on a resume
* It will take longer to write UX so UI may be very boring looking but UX will be impressive
* More real world applications
* User inputs weight in:
o Dry in lb oz(to tenth)
o Wet in oz(to best measurement)
* Database should include:
o A previous baseline of inventory amounts 
o Weekly product sales
o Weekly Discounts reports
o Returns/comps reports
* General Idea of this program is:
o Take in weekly sales reports
o Divide them into product by product basis
o Use user input/stored recipes and stored products to determine over/under on product usage
o Provide a way to add/delete specific items
o Flag products that have been overused causing a loss to the business
o Flag products that have been underused showing that some menu items are not being made properly
o Ideally display a weekly updated report that shows statistics of sales and gains/losses due to inventory and compile yearly reports
o Users should have options to choose between dates to create new graphs, although this will be extra if we have the time, can be edited in later on for actual use at home
* Testing of this program will consist of:
o Loading a preset amount of recipes into the program(these will be loaded in as objects that the user can input/load in from text file)
o User must manually enter each weeks inventory which will be stored in a database(we can precompile some kind of local database to use for this, or use xml files whichever is easier)
o These files can either be manually selected or stored doesn't matter to me as long as we meet parameters
o Building command line program first then port to GUI will most likely be the best way of attack here
